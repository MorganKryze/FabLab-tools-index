# Introduction

> This documentation is a repository for all the tools available in the Fablab. It is intended to be a quick reference for the users of the Fablab.

:::warning

This documentation is a work in progress. It is not exhaustive and may contain errors. If you have any questions or suggestions, please contact the Fablab team.

:::warning

Working in a Fablab is not a risk-free activity and needs time to process which protection will be adapted to which fabrication technique. Precipitation and lack of knowledge will be the main cause of accidents.

Please take the time to read carefully the next guide before using any of the tools.
If you may have any doubt or inquiry, please refer to your supervisor.
