## Introduction

Working in a Fablab is not a risk-free activity and needs time to process which protection will be adapted to which fabrication technique. Precipitation will be the main cause of accidents.

This guide will tackle both prevention equipments as well as response to danger procedures.

If you may have any doubt or inquiry, please refer to your supervisor.

## PPE | Personal Protective Equipment

Personal Protective Equipment is a must-have in a Fablab. It is the first line of defense against accidents. Here is a list of PPE available in the Fablab:

## Fire extinguisher

There exist two types of fire extinguishers that we could use :

- **Water extinguisher** : This type of extinguisher is used for class A fires. It displays a high efficiency in extinguishing wood, paper, and textile fires. It is not recommended for electrical fires or flammable liquids as it dispenses water at a high pressure.
- **CO2 extinguisher** : This type of extinguisher is used for class B and C fires. It is efficient in extinguishing electrical fires and flammable liquids. It is not recommended for class A fires as it does not cool down the fire.

## First aid kit

You may find in the corridor a first aid kit. It contains the following items :

- **Bandages** : To cover wounds and stop bleeding.
- **Compression gaze pads** : To stop bleeding.
- **Disinfectant** : To clean wounds.
- **Scissors** : To cut bandages.
- **Tweezers** : To remove splinters.
- **Blanket** : To keep the victim warm.
- **Triangular bandage** : To immobilize a limb.
- **Gloves** : To protect the first aider.
- **Eye wash** : To clean eyes.

For more information, an exhaustive list is available on the first aid kit itself.

## Callable numbers

In case of emergency, here are the numbers you should call :

- **Firefighters** : 18 (direct line from the building)
- **Ambulance** : 15
- **Poison control center** : 01 40 05 48 48
