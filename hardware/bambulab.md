## Introduction

Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing is the most common method for 3D printing. It involves depositing a thread of molten thermoplastic material onto a plate, layer by layer, to create a 3-dimensional object.

The necessary equipment for 3D printing is as follows:

- An FDM 3D printer (here Bambulab X1 Carbon)
- Thermoplastic filament
- A computer with slicing software
- The object file to be printed

## The Printer

In this section, we will go through the different modules found in an FDM 3D printer.

### The AMS (specific to Bambulab)

The Bambulab AMS is an automatic material management system that allows 3D printing with up to four different filaments without having to manually change the spools. It uses an automatic filament recognition system (RFID) to identify the spools and an automatic spool changing system (ABC) to change them automatically when the filament runs out. The AMS is also equipped with a filament drying system to eliminate moisture and improve print quality.

### Extruder

The extruder is the module that pulls the filament. It consists of a stepper motor that drives a gear that advances the filament into the heating body. It is prone to clogging or jamming during use (useful to know for troubleshooting).
The extruder of the Bambulab X1 Carbon printer is a direct extruder. This means it is located directly above the printing plate. This allows for better control of the temperature and pressure of the filament, resulting in higher quality prints. The X1 Carbon extruder is also equipped with a water-cooling system, which allows for printing high-temperature filaments such as PETG and Nylon.

### Heating Body

After passing through the extruder, the filament goes into the heating body. It consists of a PTFE (Teflon) tube that guides the filament to the nozzle. It is also equipped with a heating cartridge that melts the filament and a temperature sensor that controls the filament temperature. The temperatures vary depending on the filaments used (see below).

### Plate

Finally, the plate is the surface on which the printing is done. It is heated to allow better adhesion of the filament. It is also equipped with a temperature sensor that controls the plate temperature. The temperatures also vary depending on the filaments used (see below). Textured plates exist to improve filament adhesion. It is also possible to use removable printing surfaces (BuildTak, PEI, or satin) to facilitate the removal of the print.

## Filaments

3D printer filament is one of the most commonly used categories of 3D printing materials in the world. Unlike powder and liquid resin and other 3D printing technologies, filament is produced in the form of a fine, continuous plastic thread several hundred meters long, which is generally wound onto a spool for storage and feeding into the printer. Determined by the thermal extrusion process of FDM printers, the raw material of the filament is a thermoplastic material including the most commonly used plastics in life, as well as some special formula materials for certain uses.

Here is a list of the most common materials for FDM 3D printing:
